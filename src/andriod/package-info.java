/**
 * This package contains a maze-solving "Android" that is an extended version of 
 * the becker.robots package by Byron Weber Becker. It also contains an 
 * application that will collect user input in regards to where they would like 
 * the Android to navigate, and maze size. This application then creates an 
 * Android and MazeCity to place the Android in. It then prompts the Android to 
 * find it's way to the coordinates specified by the user, within the maze.
* 
* Once the android has reached it's destination, a user may specify another 
* destination for the Android. A new android is created and travels to the new 
* location, the previous android remains at the previous destination and turns 
* blue.
